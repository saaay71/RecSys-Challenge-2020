# RecSys-Challenge-2020


This repository contains the source codes of our approach for the ACM RecSys Challenge(2020).

The json files are apache zeppelin notebooks. The ouputs of the paragraph can be seen on zeppelin.
If you don't have zeppelin installed, you can read the code in jupyter notebooks folder.

You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt4dWb_QopQ) we did before the challenge was finished.
